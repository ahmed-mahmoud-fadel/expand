/**
 * Configures and returns the express-jwt middleware for use in the application.
 * This middleware automatically validates JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and sets the `req.auth`
 * object for authenticated routes. It uses a secret key from environment variables for
 * token verification and supports only the HS256 algorithm.
 *
 * Additionally, it integrates a token revocation check, allowing the application to deny
 * access based on revoked tokens, enhancing security by enabling token invalidation
 * even before their expiration.
 *
 * The middleware is configured to bypass authentication for specific public paths,
 * such as user login and registration, and certain blog content that is meant to be
 * publicly accessible without authentication.
